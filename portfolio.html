            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Margaret aka Maggie. I would like to tell you a little
              about my story. So here goes:
            </p>
            <p>
              I am from Lewiston, Maine. I am 39 years old and I am a recovering
              addict with four children. I have struggled with a lot of things
              in my life, so to deal with all of it I tried to mask all the
              feelings I had with drugs and alcohol. For example, I was raped
              when I was 4 and 11. The guy tried again when I was 13. I ran away
              from home at 13 because my dad raised four kids alone and I felt
              he wasn't paying attention to me as much as I needed. I started
              using at this age because I was afraid to say no to guys and
              thought that was the only way to be loved. If I did drugs and
              drank alcohol, I could give men what they wanted, I wouldn't feel
              abandoned and/or scared.
            </p>
            <p>
              At ages 14 and 15, I had two miscarriages, then at age 23 I had 4 wonderful kids, then 
              at age 25 I had to have a hysterectomy because I was 6 weeks pregnant with a  tubal pregnancy.
              That experience was the worst for me. That's when I was dealing with my kids being taken away by DHHS already. 
               Now I have four children
              who are mad at me because I was an addict and wasn't there for
              them and decided to choose drugs and alcohol. I didn't have my
              mother around for 21 years because she was a user, so when I had
              my own children I didn't know how to be a mother. When I found my
              mother, I then found out she has been over 15 years sober. But not
              knowing that when I had my own kids, I became my own mother, so I
              understand how my kids feel. I have been sober since May 24th,
              2024 but because of the choices I have made I have currently
              landed myself in prison. I am working on being a better person,
              mother, daughter, and partner while being sober. I may not have
              been there for my children, but maybe I will have the chance to be
              a mimi to my grandchildren. I have had a rollercoaster ride off
              and on my whole life. I have made some really bad choices and I
              have made some really good choices, but the last 10 years have
              been bad for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              MY RECOVERY IS MY #1 CONCERN RIGHT NOW. That is why I am telling
              my story to try and help other people. Before I came to prison I
              was staying at a Sober house in Hinckley, Maine called Shiller
              Ranch it is part of El Rancho treatment center in Hinckley. They
              have been truly amazing and helpful in my recovery.
