        <section class="p5">
          Anyone who has been a part of any kind of violence and addiction, I am
          here to help with resources and programs to help with recovery. So I
          am here to encourage any and everyone who is willing to take the
          Journey of recovery. As long as we have each other we can recover with
          the supports.

    <section class="p2">
      Acceptance Prayer: Acceptance is the answer to ALL of my problems today.
      When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing or
      situation—some fact of my life—unacceptable to me, and I can find no
      serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being
      exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely
      nothing, happens in God's world by mistake. Until I could accept my
      addiction, I could not stay sober; unless I accept my life completely on
      life's terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what
      needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and
      in my attitudes.
